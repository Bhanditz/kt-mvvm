##Bindings

[kt-mvvm](../README.md) implements the MVVM-pattern using declarative bindings 
in the view. Whenever the viewmodel changes, the bound parts view will update accordingly.

We decided to reuse the great [knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) library for this. 
Most of their great [documentation of bindings](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html) also applies for [kt-mvvm](../README.md) except the viewmodels we bind to are written in Kotlin.
