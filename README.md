# Beautiful portable UIs with kotlin-mvvm

We love the Model View ViewModel pattern. We love Kotlin. Therefore we combined them. 


Imagine beautiful views rendered with HTML 5 and all the view and business logic written in Kotlin.


Write your application once and deploy it to *desktop*, **Android**, **iOS** and *browser*
with the help of [portable presenters](https://github.com/dukescript/dukescript-presenters#readme).
